- Add authentication through more traditional [username/password databases](https://auth0.com/docs/connections/database/custom-db).
- Add support for [linking different user accounts](https://auth0.com/docs/link-accounts) with the same user.
- Support for generating signed [JSON Web Tokens](https://auth0.com/docs/jwt) to call your APIs and **flow the user identity** securely.
- Analytics of how, when, and where users are logging in.
- Pull data from other sources and add it to the user profile, through [JavaScript rules](https://auth0.com/docs/rules/current).
